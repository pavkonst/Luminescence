# Luminescence based on Lambert W function.
# One can study about the different spreadsheets by following this DOI to the respective paper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apradiso.2021.109870
# All files use some macro (adding the Lambert W function to excel) so a firewall bybass may be essential in some cases. 
# The spreadsheets are free and anyone can tinker with them as they please. 
# That said, be carefull about the Lambert W function, as it is written in VBA in the back-end of the excel. To access the VBA editor press F5.
# The CW_OSL_Lambert_W_with_N file shows the same equations as the CW_OSL_Lambert_W file. The only difference is that there is no I0 parameter and the basic Lambert_W equation stands as it is. 
# The CW_OSL_Lambert_W_localized shows a whole different approach based on the localized transition.
